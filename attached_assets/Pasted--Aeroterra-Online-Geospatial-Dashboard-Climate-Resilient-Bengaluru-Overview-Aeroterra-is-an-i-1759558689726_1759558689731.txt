	💧 Lake Health Index (water quality, algal bloom risk)
	🌫️ Air Quality Index (pollution hotspots)
	🌳 Green Cover (%) (vegetation monitoring)
o	Updated in real time for day-to-day awareness.
2.	Environmental Overview Map
o	Interactive satellite map powered by NASA MODIS, Landsat, and VIIRS.
o	Detects heat islands, shrinking lakes, unplanned urban growth, and deforestation zones.
3.	Stakeholder Dashboard and Dashboard Modules
o	Citizens → monitor AQI, weather, and lake conditions.
o	Policymakers → get evidence-based lake/air/land reports.
o	Urban Planners → identify new housing, transit, and green corridors.
